   - CORS enabled for cross-origin requests
   - Token generation successful

2. **WebSocket Server (Port 3004)**: ✅ Running
   - Health check passed
   - Active sessions: 2
   - Ready for real-time communication

3. **HTTP Server (Port 8080)**: ✅ Running
   - Serving static files correctly
   - Both demo pages loaded successfully

### Demo Pages Tested

1. **bilingual-speaker-style.html**: ✅ Loaded
   - Professional broadcasting interface
   - Session code generation working
   - WebSocket connection established

2. **bilingual-translation-continuous-fix.html**: ✅ Loaded
   - Debug panel showing recognizer status
   - Enhanced continuous recognition support
   - Proper event handling implemented

### Key Features to Test Manually

1. **Language Detection**
   - French Canadian recognition
   - English Canadian recognition
   - Automatic language switching

2. **Continuous Recognition**
   - Should not stop after first word
   - Proper handling of pauses and silence
   - Interim results streaming

3. **WebSocket Communication**
   - Real-time transcript broadcasting
   - Listener connection support
   - Session-based rooms

### Testing Instructions

1. **Basic Test**:
   - Click "Start Broadcasting" in either demo
   - Speak in French: "Bonjour, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui?"
   - Observe language detection switches to French
   - Continue speaking to test continuous recognition
   - Switch to English: "Hello, how are you doing today?"
   - Observe language detection switches to English

2. **Continuous Recognition Test**:
   - Speak a long sentence without pauses
   - Verify recognition continues throughout
   - Pause mid-sentence and resume
   - Verify recognition picks up where it left off

3. **Language Switching Test**:
   - Mix French and English in the same session
   - "Je vais to the store pour acheter some milk"
   - Observe how the system handles code-switching

### Known Improvements in Fixed Version

1. **Enhanced Speech SDK Configuration**:
   - `enableDictation()` properly configured
   - Segmentation timeout settings added
   - End silence timeout configured

2. **Better Event Handling**:
   - All recognition states monitored
   - Session events tracked
   - Speech start/end detection

3. **Debug Information**:
   - Real-time recognizer status
   - Event counter for monitoring activity
   - Language confidence display

### Recommendations

1. Test with actual speech input for at least 2-3 minutes
2. Monitor the browser console for any errors
3. Check WebSocket messages in browser DevTools
4. Verify translations appear in real-time
5. Test with different accents and speaking speeds

### API Keys Status

- Speech API tokens are being generated successfully
- Region: eastus
- Token expiration handled automatically by SDK

### Next Steps

1. Perform actual voice testing with bilingual speakers
2. Monitor latency metrics during real-world usage
3. Test with multiple concurrent listeners
4. Validate translation accuracy
5. Test edge cases (background noise, multiple speakers)
